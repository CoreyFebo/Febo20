***Call these:
     source ~/.bashrc
     nano ~/.bashrc


***this must be added to your file: export PATH=$PATH:/home/cefebo/my_executables
***edit the file to look like this
***here is my file- add the file path at the very end
     # .bashrc

     # Source global definitions
     if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
             . /etc/bashrc
     fi

     # Uncomment the following line if you don't like systemctl's auto-paging feature:
     # export SYSTEMD_PAGER=

     # User specific aliases and functions
     
     export PATH=$PATH:/home/cefebo/my_executables

***the source code should already be compiled if not you can go to the source and compile it yourself by doing
     gcc -std=c99 -g resdis.c -o resdis -lm
***this file is located in /home/cefebo/my_executables/Code Files/ in my case
***move the resdis file to /home/cefebo/my_executables/ but keep the resdis.c file in the /Code Files/ directory

***now you can call resdis and other self-defined programs at any time!
